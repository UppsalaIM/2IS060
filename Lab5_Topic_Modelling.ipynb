    "In this lab session, we will try out some *topic modelling*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring subject in natural language processing and text analytics is to understand large corpus of texts through topics extraction. Whether you analyze users' online reviews, products' descriptions, or text entered in search bars, understanding key topics will always come in handy. This also applies to social media data, such as user posts on social networks, emails, and blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lab, we looked at *sentiment analysis*, which aims to determine the emotional tone behind words. By doing this we can classify documents as being positive or negative in tone. In topic modelling, we try and extract what documents are talking about by using statistics and computation.\n",

    "In this lab, you will see how we can extract possible topics from articles posted on the BBC News website.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lda.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the LDA method, let me remind you that not reinventing the wheel and going for the quick solution is usually the best start. Several providers have great API for topic extraction (and it is free up to a certain number of calls): [Google](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/), [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-entity-linking), [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/topics-extraction)... and all of the three and all work very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if your data is highly specific, and no generic topic can represent it, then you will have to go for a more personalized approach. This lab focuses on one of these approaches: LDA."

      "Situated in the southern Aegean Sea, Santorini is a small, circular group of five Cycladic islands, made up of main island Thera; Therasia and Aspronisi at the periphery; and the two lava islands. All five surround a colossal, mostly drowned caldera, a bowl-shaped crater that forms when the mouth of a volcano collapses. But during the Bronze Age, approximately 5,000 years ago, Santorini was a single volcanic landmass called Stronghyle (which means âroundâ in Greek), and one that played a crucial role in shaping history.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Around that time, a civilisation started developing on the nearby island of Crete. The inhabitants were the Minoans, named for mythical King Minos, an enigmatic and educated people, who were warriors but also merchants, artists and seafarers. The Minoansâ ancestry has been the subject of hot dispute: some believe they were refugees from Egypt's Nile Delta, while others say they hailed from ancient Palestine, Syria or North Mesopotamia. The most recent research says the Minoan civilisation was a local development, originated by early farmers who lived in Greece and south-western Anatolia. Whatever the case, there is little doubt that between 2600 and 1100BC a sublimely sophisticated and advanced civilisation thrived here. Excavations in Crete, especially in Knossos (the capital of Minoan Crete), have unearthed the remains of a spectacular palace, golden jewellery and elegant frescoes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over the centuries, the Minoan empire extended over the island of Rhodes (309km east of Stronghyle) as well as parts of the Turkish coast and perhaps as far as Egypt and Syria. Stronghyle (now Santorini) was an especially important outpost for the Minoans due to its privileged position on the copper trade route between Cyprus and Minoan Crete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe excavations in Akrotiri [a village in Santoriniâs south-west] have found three-storey houses, vast and elaborate palaces, Europe's first paved roads, running water and a spectacular sewage system,â said Paraskevi Nomikou, assistant professor in geological oceanography and natural geography at the University of Athens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most fascinating of all, Europeâs first writing systems were found in buildings in Akrotiri and on the faces of Bronze Age rocks in the Cretan palaces of Knossos and Malia: it was here that the Minoans inscribed the first of their written words, initially in the form of Cretan Hieroglyphics and later in Linear A.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cretan Hieroglyphs is an ancient script of around 137 pictorials that look like plants, animals, body parts, weapons, ships and other objects, and is believed to have been in use until 1700BC. Gradually, the Minoans refined Cretan Hieroglyphs down to the much more stylised Linear A, which took the linguistic helm until about 1450BC. Linear A had various numbers, 200 signs and also more than 70 syllable signs, making it more like language as we know it today (though both scripts remain undeciphered).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rightfully, the creators of Europeâs earliest written script have been hailed as the continentâs first literate and advanced civilisation. And their intellectual achievements were only surpassed by their uninhibited way of living, celebrating the joy of life even at funerals, playing with bulls instead of killing them and living in blissful harmony with nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And it was nature that finally decided to kill them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between 1627 and 1600 BCE, the Late Bronze Eruption (commonly called the Minoan or Santorini Eruption), perhaps the greatest eruption in 10,000 years, took place on Stronghyle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nature that finally decided to kill them\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPrior to the eruption, the modern caldera did not exist. Instead a smaller caldera, from a much older eruption, formed a lagoon at the north of the island,â Nomikou said. âDuring the eruption, titanic flows of 60m-thick landslides of volcanic material fell onto the sea, triggering 9m-high tsunami waves that smashed onto the shores of Crete.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waves may have reached western Turkey and even Israel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once the cataclysm ended, the modern caldera began to form (though conjuring into existence the modern Santorini would take several thousand years).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the Minoans it was the beginning of the end. âThe volcanic destruction decimated their commercial boats, and the huge amount of carbon dioxide that was released in the atmosphere disturbed the climate balance, destroying Minoan agriculture. All this gradually enabled the Mycenaeans [a Bronze Age civilisation that inhabited mainland Greece between 1600 and 1100 BCE] to seize their chance to put an end to Minoan independence.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what startles Nomikou is that, unlike the ancient Roman town-city of Pompeii, which got buried in more than 6m of volcanic ash and pumice in the wake of Vesuvius in 79AD, no bodies have ever been found on Santorini.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBy all appearances, the people of Santorini were warned in advance and escaped,â she said. To this day, no-one knows where they went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if Santorini destroyed Europeâs first great civilisation, it did not destroy language. Once the more-belligerent Mycenaeans ruled over the previous Minoan empire, they replaced Linear A with their own evolved version, Linear B, the first attested writing system of the Greeks, which eventually led to the Ancient Greek language that spread democracy, scientific reasoning, theatre and philosophy around the world.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYou can still smell cavallines if you sacrifice the convenience of your car,â he added, looking straight ahead at the volcanic islands, behind which fiery colours stretching from deep red to ultra-violet were brewing as the sun prepared to set.\r\n",

He has led Tuareg uprisings against the Malian government, acted as go-between in securing the release of hostages kidnapped by al-Qaeda, and spent time as a Malian diplomat in Saudi Arabia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little-known figure who rarely speaks to the press, Mr Ghaly's motivation for founding Ansar Dine remains the subject of some debate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He comes from the Ifoghas tribe and the Kidal region of north-eastern Mali. Believed to be now in his mid-fifties, he first came to public attention in the early 1990s as the leader of a Tuareg revolt seeking independence or greater autonomy for the northern region of Mali that they call Azawad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Malian state radio referred to him in 1991 as the secretary-general of the Popular Movement of Azawad and head of the delegation negotiating an end to the rebellion with the government. In 1995 Radio France International called him the \"undisputed leader\" of the Tuareg rebels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After another, short-lived revolt in 2006, Mr Ghaly became head of a movement called the 23 May Democratic Alliance for Change. The following year he was reported to be a member of the Malian High Council of Territorial Collectivities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hostage mediator\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In August 2003 he played the key role in securing the release of 14 mostly German tourists kidnapped by the Algerian Salafi Group for Call and Combat, GSPC, which later became Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). He negotiated further hostage releases in 2008, 2010 and 2011.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although European governments denied paying ransoms, these kidnappings are believed to have earned GSPC/AQIM tens of millions of dollars.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks referred to Mr Ghaly as turning up \"like the proverbial bad penny\" whenever there was the prospect of \"a cash transaction\" between the Tuareg and a foreign government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between late 2007 and early 2010 he held a post at the Malian consulate in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, although at times during this period he was reported as being in Mali and elsewhere negotiating hostage releases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several Malian press reports say he left this post after Saudi Arabia declared him persona non grata for having contact with terrorist elements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in mid-2011, Mr Ghaly reportedly sought the leadership of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), newly-formed by returning Tuareg who had served in the Libyan army, but he was rebuffed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An MNLA official told Le Monde in April 2012 that this was because of links with AQIM, but that it was unclear whether this association was \"out of conviction or out of opportunism\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other sources say Mr Ghaly was rejected because of his \"close ties\" with the Malian government, a suspicion which dates back to the rebellion of 1990, when he was seen as having compromised in the course of negotiations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Ghaly has also faced problems within the Ifoghas tribe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After reportedly being overlooked during a takeover of leadership of the tribe in 2011, he was then condemned by the tribal chief and religious leaders for his \"personal project\", Ansar Dine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pro-MNLA website Toumastpress reported that the tribal chief asked Ansar Dine to lay down their arms or leave the region.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Religious influence\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Ghaly's establishment of Ansar Dine could be seen as a response to setbacks he experienced in the internal Tuareg power struggle, but alongside this Tuareg nationalism one can also trace the development of strong religious beliefs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Image caption Ansar Dine fighters have destroyed several famous shrines in Timbuktu\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He is said to have been attracted to the teachings of a Muslim missionary group, Tablighi Jama'at, which is non-political and condemns violence. He also spent some time in 2002 studying at a mosque in Saint Denis in France.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His subsequent interactions with GSPC/AQIM and his time in Saudi Arabia may have moved his religious orientation in a more hard-line direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In 2011 he reportedly told the Ifoghas tribal meeting that he wanted to impose Islamic law on the Tuareg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Ansar Dine's seizure of Timbuktu in April 2012, Mr Ghaly made a statement on the local radio in which he announced \"jihad against the opponents of the Sharia\" and \"enmity to the unbelievers and polytheists\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He also called on the local inhabitants to assist Ansar Dine in \"establishing the religion, spreading justice, security and ruling between people with justice, and promoting virtue and preventing of vice\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Potential deal-maker\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is difficult to ascertain his motivation for founding Ansar Dine because reliable, first-hand information about him is scarce, and conspiracy theories abound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of these theories sees Mr Ghaly and AQIM as tools of the Algerian (and even US) security services. Another considers him a long-term collaborator with the Malian government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The depth of his adherence to the Islamist cause remains to be seen. As the recent experience in Yemen of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has shown, when a jihadist group seeks to hold populated areas it leaves itself open to a concerted military counteroffensive with international support.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By adding the Islamist banner to his status among the Tuareg, Mr Ghaly may just be manoeuvring himself into a position from which he can emerge, as in the past, as the deal-maker.\r\n",

She has worked with dwarf birch and turned driftwood into celebrated Sami art, but her current project is more ambitious.

      "At Akramawi, a 65-year-old hummus joint by Damascus Gate in Jerusalem, a cook named Nader Tarawe was showing me how to prepare hummus. The recipe for hummus bâtahini (as the dish is named; âhummusâ simply means âchickpeasâ), consists of chickpeas, tahini, garlic and lemon. Since itâs relatively simple to make, the variations lie more in how itâs served. Should it be it smooth or lumpy, heavier on the tahini or on the chickpeas, crowned with fava beans or more chickpeas or pine nuts or ground beef? And whatâs on the side? Chips? Pickles? Hot sauce? Falafel?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tarawe topped each plate of hummus with a dollop of tahini and a sprinkling of olive oil. âOil is good,â he said, an accidental Middle East metaphor. Hummus is a regional metaphor, too: beloved all over the world, itâs yet another source of tension, yet another question of proprietorship. Who invented the dish? Who can claim it as their own?\r\n",

      "Everyone from the Lebanese to the Turks to the Syrians have tried, but thereâs little evidence for any theory. Most of the ingredients have been around for centuries: the chickpea dates back more than 10,000 years in Turkey and is, according to Anissa Helou, Syrian-Lebanese author of several Middle Eastern cookbooks, âone of the earliest legumes ever cultivated.â And tahini, the sesame paste that is vital to hummus bâtahini, is mentioned in 13th-Century Arabic cookbooks. But the combination of ingredients that make up the popular dish is harder to pin down.\r\n",

      "Hummus is a regional metaphor: beloved all over the world, itâs yet another source of tension\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Itâs a Jewish food,â said chef Tom Kabalo of Raq Hummus in the Israeli-occupied territory of Golan Heights a few days later. âIt was mentioned in our bible 3,500 years ago.â I was in his restaurant eating his Tuesday special. Because it was October, the special was âHalloween hummusâ, garnished with shredded pumpkin and black tahini.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Heâs not the only one who told me that hummus is biblical. Kabalo and others are referring to a passage from the Book of Ruth, part of the third and final section of the Hebrew Bible: âCome hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the hometz.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While itâs true that hometz does sound like hummus, thereâs also a good reason to believe otherwise: in modern Hebrew, hometz means vinegar. Of course, âdip your bread in vinegarâ would be an odd expression of hospitality, so therein lies the uncertainty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâve heard claims that it was first cultivated in northern India or Nepal,â said Oren Rosenfeld, writer and director of Hummus! The Movie. Said Liora Gvion, author of Beyond Hummus and Falafel: Social and Political Aspects of Palestinian Food in Israel, âI think it is an old and stupid debate that is not worth oneâs attention.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But for many, the question of where hummus comes from is absolutely a matter of patriotism and identity. The now legendary âHummus Warsâ began in 2008 when Lebanon accused Israel of cashing in on what they believed should have been Lebanonâs legacy, publicity and money. The president of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists, angry that hummus had come to be known and marketed throughout the west as an Israeli dish, sued Israel for infringement of food-copyright laws. The Lebanese government petitioned the EU to recognise hummus as Lebanese. Both efforts proved ineffectual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question of where hummus comes from is absolutely a matter of patriotism and identity\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cultural appropriation is a hot topic in the food world (just ask the Peruvians and Chileans who owns pisco, for example), so the hummus debate could have generated an interesting conversation. Instead, the whole thing devolved into the culinary version of a dance-off: in 2009, Fadi Abboud, Lebanese minister of tourism, decided that the way to settle the matter once and for all was for Lebanon to make a plate of hummus so large it would be recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records. The goal was achieved, the record set with a plate of hummus that weighed around 2,000kg. In response, Jawdat Ibrahim, a famous Arab-Israeli hummus joint in Abu Ghosh, Israel, retaliated with hummus served in a satellite dish that had a diameter of 6.5m â about 4,000kg of hummus. Then the Lebanese counter-attacked with 10,452kg of the dip â the number of square kilometers of Lebanon. They have held the record since 2010.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLebanonâs efforts were interesting, but they canât be taken seriously,â Rosenfeld said. âHummus is a Middle Eastern food claimed by all and owned by none.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most people who talk about the Hummus Wars hold Rosenfeldâs diplomatic view. But American food historian Charles Perry, president of the Culinary Historians of Southern California and an expert on medieval Arab food, gives Lebanon some credit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hummus is a Middle Eastern food claimed by all and owned by none\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI tend to take the Lebanese claim somewhat seriously,â he said. âBeirut would be my second choice in response to the question of who invented hummus. It stood out as a sophisticated city throughout the Middle Ages, one with a vigorous culinary tradition, and lemons were abundant there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Damascus, Syria, strikes him as the more likely candidate. He explained that the traditional way of serving hummus throughout much of the Middle East is in a particular red clay bowl with a raised edge. The hummus is whisked around briskly with a pestle so that it mounds up along that edge. Not only does this present the hummus conveniently for picking up with bread, it proves that the hummus has the proper texture, neither too slack nor too stiff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe practice of whipping hummus up against the wall of the bowl indicates a sophisticated urban product, not an ancient folk dish. I'm inclined to think hummus was developed for the Turkish rulers in Damascus,â Perry said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Explaining his choice, he continued: âNobody can say who invented hummus, or when. Or where, particularly given the eagerness with which people in the Middle East borrow one anotherâs dishes. But I associate it with Damascus in the 18th Century because it was the largest city with a sophisticated ruling class,â he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, another popular theory says that hummus is neither biblical nor Lebanese nor Syrian, but Egyptian. âThe earliest recipe Iâve seen for hummus that includes tahini is from an Egyptian cookbook,â said Middle East historian Ari Ariel, who teaches history and international studies at the University of Iowa. Cookbooks from 13th-Century Cairo describe a dish made of cold pureed chickpeas, vinegar, pickled lemon and herbs and spices. Many claim that itâs the hummus we enjoy today. But is it fair to consider those recipes hummus bâtahini if thereâs no tahini? No garlic?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe thing you have to bear in mind about historical cookbooks,â Perry said, âis that they tend to record fashionable dishes, and fashionable dishes eventually become unfashionable, so a modern dish that somewhat resembles an ancient one may not have a historical connection.â In response to the Egypt theory, he continued, âHistorically, Egypt has been more likely to adopt Syrian dishes than vice versa.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Back at Akramawi, I sat at a communal table where I met Noam Yatsiv, a tour guide from the Israeli port city Haifa, who takes his hummus very seriously. He told me that he eats hummus five times a week and has a dog named Hummus, and that hummus comes from Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll of them?â I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yatsiv shrugged. He told me that it doesnât matter where itâs from. What matters is the way itâs been co-opted and sold commercially in grocery stores in plastic containers. âThatâs not hummus!â he said, tearing a piece of pita. âThere should be a sign on that hummus the way there is on âkosher shrimpâ. It should be labelled âfake hummusâ. There should be an international law.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most of the people I spoke with couldnât agree on where hummus comes from, or on the extent to which it matters. Kabalo said that the more important question is, whoâs making it the best? (âYouâre looking at him,â he added, spreading his arms.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the hummus solidarity I found on my travels was the result of a different question. There was common ground among just about everyone I met who slings hummus for a living â from Tarawe at Akramawi to the Christian Maronite family who run Abu George Hummus in the Old City of Acre, Israel, to the hipsters at Ha Hummus Shel Tâchina in Jerusalemâs Nachlaot neighbourhood who give their leftover hummus to the homeless each night â every time I asked, âWhatâs your secret ingredient?â\r\n",

      "Not far from the Belgian border, the Netherlands municipality of Baarle-Nassau is home to nearly 30 Belgian enclaves, known collectively as Baarle-Hertog. On the map, they look like cartographic amoebae, some of them with Dutch nuclei inside.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This whole confused mess dates to the Middle Ages when parcels of land were divvied up between different local aristocratic families. Baarle-Hertog once belonged to the Duke (hertog is the Dutch word for âdukeâ) of Brabant, while Baarle-Nassau was the property of the medieval House of Nassau. When Belgium declared independence from the Netherlands in 1831, the two nations were left with an international muddle so complicated that successive regimes were deterred from defining exact jurisdictions. The borders were not actually finalised until 1995, when the last remaining piece of no manâs land was attributed to Belgium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On first impression, itâs not easy to tell the territories apart, as they look no different from any typical red-brick small Dutch town. Around three-quarters of the regionâs roughly 9,000 total residents are Dutch passport holders, and the Dutch municipality also has by far the larger share of land (76 sq km compared to 7.5 sq km). But after a while the differences become apparent, albeit with the help of pavement markings â white crosses with âNLâ on one side and âBâ on the other â and house numbers which are marked with the appropriate flag.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dutch properties are more uniform in appearance than their Belgian counterparts, and Dutch pavements are lined with lime trees, their limbs carefully pruned and braided like vines. The Belgian areas tend to be more architecturally diverse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If I had an ear for it, Iâd be able to differentiate accents, too, explained Willem van Gool, chairman of the Baarle tourist office (himself a Dutch passport holder, though his mother is Belgian). Although French is taught in the Belgian schools, Dutch is the primary language of both communities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, van Gool noted, âWith the Belgians it is more like a dialect, and with the Dutch it is moreâ¦ clean.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That, and the less prescriptive approach to residential landscaping on the Belgian side, has led to a tendency on the part of some of the Dutch to look down on their neighbours. âBack in the days when the schools emptied out at the same time, teenagers would fight,â recalled van Gool, but that all stopped in the 1960s when the townâs two mayors (one Dutch and one Belgian) altered the school timings so that they didnât overlap and combined the youth club to promote positive interactions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Today, many residents of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog have dual citizenship and both a Belgian and a Dutch passport. The peaceful interweaving of the two nations has attracted the interest of advisors to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as an example of how two different communities can live harmoniously together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So is all this border obscurity to Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertogâs benefit? It certainly attracts tourists, said van Gool. âThe number of shops, hotels and cafes we have would be more suited to a town of 40,000 rather than 9,000. And when the Belgian shops have to close on Sunday, the Dutch donât.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The complexities can still prove difficult, however, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Building permits can be particularly tricky, said Leo van Tilburg, mayor of the Belgian municipality, whose town hall is bisected by the border. Because of its location, Belgium had to seek Dutch permission to build part of their mayoral building â the part delineated by the brightly illuminated border strip running right through the meeting room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything is a matter of negotiation\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Much of Tilburgâs time is devoted to sorting out the delivery of services â education, water, infrastructure â in co-operation with his Dutch counterpart, Marjon de Hoon. Resurfacing the roads is his particular bugbear, as roads can cross borders several times within a few hundred metres. And then there are issues like the planning of sewage pipes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe road under which the pipe is being installed may be all Belgian, but who pays if the pipework has to be enlarged thanks to Dutch houses nearby? And who pays to service the streetlights, where the pavement is Belgian but the light shines on Dutch windows?â Tilburg said. â[But] if there are 100 problems, 98 of them will turn out to be no problem â after plenty of discussions, of course.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything is a matter of negotiation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Given that Belgiumâs planning laws are less restrictive than the Netherlandsâ, there are clear advantages to having a front door in Belgium, as Kees de Hoon (no relation to the Dutch mayor) explained when I met him at his border-straddling apartment block. A Dutch passport-holder living in Baarle-Hertog, Kees wanted to redevelop the original building, but the front door was in the Netherlands and he couldnât get planning permission from the Dutch town hall. He solved the problem by simply installing a second front door, adjacent to the first but on the other side of the border. So now with two front doors to the building, one of his apartments is Dutch, and the other three are Belgian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was done on both sides of the border\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kees isnât the only one who has taken advantage of jurisdictional loopholes; many long-established families and business owners will admit to have benefited in some small way. The most flagrant example is a former bank that was built right on top of the border so paperwork could be moved from one side of the building to the other whenever one nationalityâs tax inspectors came calling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although loophole-exploiting isnât as common as it once was, I couldnât help imagining the glory days of cross-border rule-bending. The cattle that mysteriously changed fields overnight. The shop stock that was acquired in one country and sold in the other without bothering the tax man. âIt is a subject the locals like to talk about,â agreed van Gool, âand it was done on both sides of the border.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That doesnât mean the two jurisdictions are without friction. The drinking age in the Netherlands is 18 but Belgians can legally drink beer and wine at 16, so if a Dutch barkeeper refuses to serve a crowd of teenagers, they can just thumb their nose at him and walk across the road. And the many fireworks shops in the Belgian parts of town are a source of irritation to the Dutch authorities. In the Netherlands, the sale and carriage of fireworks is illegal (except for around the New Year). So when I came to the end of my November visit in Baarle-Nassau/Baarle-Hertog, I had to face Dutch police who were scrutinising everyone leaving town.\r\n",

      "Much farther north than the famous fjord inlets, Norwayâs northernmost seaboard of Finnmark is a frontier on the edge. Five hundred kilometres inside the Arctic Circle, it is a raw wilderness of abrupt peninsulas and brooding cliffs at the nerve ends of the world, a place where nature has long had the upper hand. In winter, as if by decree of Odin, roads vanish under deep snows that cut off communities for days. And when polar darkness descends, from mid-November to late January, it is near absolute.\r\n",

      "But as you drive along the deserted, snow-crusted road to Hammerfest, population 10,527, past barely-there fishing hamlets and cod trawlers at standstill, you soon learn that one of the worldâs northernmost towns has had far worse problems to deal with than temperatures plummeting below zero.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For Hammerfestâs history is a luckless narrative of natural disasters, fires, plagues and war, spanning a timeline from Napoleon to the Nazis. And despite being one of the most storied settlements in northern Europe, the townâs acutely modern look might strike you as odd. Look around and it feels different to elsewhere this far north.\r\n",

      "Gone are the clapboard houses so characteristic of Norway. So too are the traditional storefronts from this former whaling town. Instead, facing the harbour is the LED-lit Arctic Culture Centre, a floating glass terminal on stilts. In the middle ground â between the flat Atlantic sky and backdrop of liquefied gas depots â are modern apartment blocks and a cruise terminal. And above that, on main street Kirkegata, is a rocket ship-shaped church, a postmodern homage to Finnmarkâs triangular-shaped stockfish racks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How does Hammerfest explain this extraordinary transformation? Ever since the 18th Century, after the first European (and soon after North American) traders arrived in the ancestral homeland of the indigenous Nordic Sea Sami, the town has been destroyed, ripped apart, razed to the ground and effectively wiped from the map time and again. It has been to hell and back, numerous times, and yet keeps coming back â a phoenix of the far north.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou can trace our history back some 10,000 years, but in terms of bricks and mortar weâre an exceptionally young town,â said 75-year-old historian Jens Berg-Hansen, when we met on Kirkegata on a bleary November morning for a walk through Hammerfestâs history. âThereâs a pioneering spirit here â and thatâs the reason people come back. This is a town that engenders self-reliance. We have learnt to pull together.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What originally brought Europeans here was the townâs ice-free harbour, a result of the warm Atlantic Gulf Stream which is uncommon in such northern waters. The combination saw the development of an international hunting effort that stretched to the Arctic Ocean via the Norwegian and Barents Seas, an era when seals, whales and walruses were butchered for meat, skins and oil. As riches returned from the ocean hunting grounds, the town became an open-air factory where blubber was scraped off the cetaceansâ skins to prevent it turning rancid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey used to say you could smell Hammerfest before you could see it,â said Berg-Hansen, describing the townâs boom years in the early to mid-18th Century, which saw the arrival of Russian, German, French, Dutch and American consulate offices. âIt brought in trade, money and plenty of international visitors. They also said the ladies here were as beautiful as those in Paris because of how they dressed.â The sense of history is tangible: still today the streets are home to a disproportionate number of boutiques and hairdressers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such good times couldnât last, however, a history documented at the appropriately named Gjenreisningsmuseet, the Museum of Reconstruction for Finnmark and North Troms (named after two neighbouring regions in Norwayâs north).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first blow came when the port â due to its ice-free harbour and strategic location en route to Russia, the Arctic and the UK â was overrun during the Napoleonic Wars. In July 1809, the British plundered and looted Hammerfest during a Â­Â­week-long blockade, leaving the city to starve. Half a century later, a hurricane dismantled the townâs warehouses, before tragedy struck again in 1890 with two-thirds of the harbourâs buildings demolished by a catastrophic bakery fire. Almost unbelievably, considering Hammerfestâs unpredictable weather and inaccessibility, the reconstruction effort led to an extensive modernisation. For example, the next year the town became the first in northern Europe to introduce electric street lights.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Far worse was to come when the town was occupied following Germanyâs invasion of Norway in 1940. Anticipating a huge Russian breakthrough at the Eastern Front four years later, Hitlerâs scorched-earth retreat saw the townâs battalion of 1,000 Nazi soldiers leave nothing behind. It was October 1944, and with no shelter, food or supplies, the plan was for the Red Army to starve and freeze to death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Within days, Hammerfest burned. Roads were wiped from the map, telegraph poles were chopped down and communication lines destroyed. The harbour lay ravaged, mines pockmarked the town and the entire population of the surrounding municipality were left homeless. So systematic was the Nazi solution, 10,000 buildings were razed to the ground and the only one left standing was the chapel. Almost unbelievably, the fires raged on for four months, and by the time the locals had fled, Hammerfest had ceased to exist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been to hell and back, and yet keeps coming back â a phoenix of the far north\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With such far-reaching consequences, families were evacuated to southern Norway, including that of 84-year-old Randi Simonsen, one of the townâs oldest surviving eye-witnesses, who Iâd earlier agreed to meet at the museum.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe Germans were so thorough they burned our basements,â said Simonsen, pointing to sepia photographs of the aftermath. âBut people here were smart and hid their possessions, even if they knew they may one day never return.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mercifully, the images of reconstruction at the museum are far more powerful than those of Hammerfestâs destruction. One exhibit shows an American-made barbershop stool, hidden under 3ft of soil by its owner to prevent it from being destroyed. Another reveals two plush velvet armchairs, fully intact if a little worn, also dug up during the post-war effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Simonsen recalled, her family were given two days to prepare to leave, not knowing when or even if they could ever return. Aged 11, she travelled with her family some 2,000km south to Telemark. âMy father had the sea in his blood, so only days after peace broke out in May 1945 he was one of the first to return, eventually taking a boat from TromsÃ¸ after first travelling north. Nobody thought not to come back.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nobody thought not to come back\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If the challenge of figuring out how to deal with disaster and recovery in the same breath weighed on Hammerfest, it doesnât show today. The town may have been left to ruin, but within weeks of the repatriation, numerous buildings and houses had been rebuilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe had no time to deal with trauma,â Simonsen said, adding that she slept on the chapel floor after her familyâs return. âPeople were happy to be home and, anyway, I was a teenager so I was preoccupied with school, fashion and â of course â boys.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another eyewitness, 72-year-old retired schoolteacher Gunnar Milch, has another theory about how Hammerfest has learnt to adapt. Itâs a happy story, in a way, of triumph over adversity, he told me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPeople sometimes have a romanticised view of the past, but it has always been tough in Hammerfest. For us it was a question of community. When people returned after World War II, they recreated their own community after having been separated from it for so long. The lesson is only we will decide our own fate.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As history now shows, Hammerfest takes its place alongside Mostar in Bosnia, Hiroshima in Japan and Dresden in Germany as a town that has been destroyed yet has risen from the ashes with a deep and defiant response. Today, Hammerfest is prospering once more due to the arrival of liquefied gas companies in a boom expected to last decades. Of little surprise to the locals, itâs simply a continuation of how the town has reinvented itself for hundreds of years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps what captures Hammerfestâs never-say-die spirit best is the townâs mascot and heraldic crest: the polar bear. It embodies the vitality of the community, but also the townâs uncanny ability to survive for centuries in a far-flung corner, on the top of the globe, despite the worst intentions of men.\r\n",

      "Few cities in the world rival the antiquity of Athens, where people have lived continuously for thousands of years. Athenians created the first forms of democracy, the plays and philosophy that shaped Western civilisation, and the classical buildings that still dot the Acropolis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amid the ancient ruins, another survivor of the centuries is the Greek concept of philoxenia â a term that directly translates as âlove of strangersâ, but which locals define more as a warmth that makes foreigners feel immediately welcomed when they come to the capital city. âThe people can be very hospitable and friendly,â agreed Julian Williams, who moved from London in 2009.\r\n",

      "Why do people love it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The always-on atmosphere of Athens attracts Greeks and expats alike. âAthens is a buzzing city,â said Chrissy Manika, an Athens native and blogger at Travel Passionate. âNo matter when you go out you will see the cafes and bars filled with people having a good time.â She especially likes wandering the city centre neighbourhood of Plaka, on the north-east side of the Acropolis. âWith all the tourists around, it feels like you are on holiday on an island, especially in summer.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With more than 250 days of sunshine annually, that summer can feel endless. âBy my American standards, âsummerâ in Athens lasts from late April to late October,â said Mina Agnos, who opened the Athens office of luxury tour company Travelive in 2008. The weather makes it especially easy to get away to nearby islands for weekend getaways. Williams recommends Hydra (35 nautical miles to the south), where cars are prohibited and people get around the island by riding donkeys and mules or leisurely walking its idyllic city streets, which mostly lack street signs. Though long popular with celebrities and artists, the island retains its laid-back lifestyle with plentiful cafes and contained crowds, thanks to the limited number of hotels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mountains and forest are also within easy reach. âIf you want to break out of the city, you can do so fairly easily and feel like youâre a million miles [away],â Williams said. âOne of my regular places to go is Mount Hymettus [5-6km from the city centre], which is ideal if you have a dog, and is also great for biking.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What's it like to live there?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite living in an ancient city, residents never get sick of the views. âDriving into the city and seeing the Acropolis or the Temple of Zeus takes my breath away,â Agnos said. âAt every turn, there is a beautiful reminder of the ancient past of this city. It is a lovely reminder of our limited time and that we should make the best of it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the antiquities, nearby neighbourhoods give a glimpse into the cityâs contemporary culture. Just steps from the Acropolis, Koukaki was recently ranked as the cityâs newest cool neighbourhood for its new National Museum of Contemporary Art, trendy restaurants and cosy cafes. For a more avant-garde feel, Williams recommends the neighbourhood of Exarcheia, 1km north-east of the city centre. âIt has a complex history and culture of student politicisation, anarchism, communism and alternative counter-culture,â he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Locals also have their own secrets that tourists often miss while theyâre museum-hopping. âSome of the best food is to be had in the local central market in downtown Athens,â said Katilena Alpe, who moved from London nine years ago. âAnd not many know that Athens has a wine route and the vineyards around the capital produce some great wines.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What else do I need to know?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As one of the countries hit hardest by the decadeâs economic strife, Greece is still a hard place to find a job, and unemployment in Athens remains high. Locals lament the time-consuming and inefficient government bureaucracy, which can cause challenges for newcomers trying to get or start a job.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âTax paperwork and Greek bureaucracy requires translation so itâs valuable having a friend who can help you navigate the bureaucratic maze to get setup,â Williams said.\r\n",

      "And while salaries are lower here in general, Athens has one of Europeâs lowest costs of living, with expenses averaging nearly 50% less than London, according to price compare site Expatistan.com.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Expats also appreciate that most Athenians speak very good English â though attempting a little Greek goes a long way. âEven if you are horrible at it, the effort is really appreciated,â Agnos said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even with its challenges, locals recommend never losing sight of the awe of Athens. âI find that the happiest expats are the ones that act like tourists,â said Agnos. âThey are visiting museums or hopping ferries to islands on the weekends, sampling lots of local dining spots, and getting to know the locals.â\r\n",

      "I gazed out the window onto a series of yellow, mud-brick cottages built on a slope, surrounded by verdant hills engulfed in a blanket of swirling fog. In the village of Masouleh, nestled deep in northern Iranâs Alborz Mountains, every view is a rooftop view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Masouleh was built partway up a steep mountainside to keep the village safe from floods in the valley below and protect it from frigid winds that whip the summit above. But to conform to the steep incline caused by a 100m elevation change, residents had to find creative ways of optimising space. Indeed, the architecture of this roughly 1,000-year-old village is such that the front garden of each house â as well as restaurants, outdoor cafes and even parts of a bazaar â sits on the rooftop of the house below it.\r\n",

The guesthouse where I was staying, like many other homes in Masouleh, had a large window that spanned the front wall of the room to let in sunlight and warmth â one of the traditional techniques to contend with cold winters. (Many of the older Masouleh homes also have a winter room at the back of the building, insulated by the thick, clay walls.)\r\n",

      "With the rise of Masouleh as a popular tourism destination in Iran, the narrow streets can sometimes feel more reminiscent of a large city than a tranquil village. With the larger hotels located at the lower levels near the village entrance, many tourists seem content to stay near the bazaar, which is surrounded by rooftop cafes and restaurants. However, the higher levels tend to be more tranquil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I finished my tea and set out to explore Masouleh. As I made my way up towards the top of the village, I glanced down to the valley, where a tour bus was slowly making its way up the inclined road to the base of the village, the point at which visitors would have to walk, as Masoulehâs alleyways do not support vehicle traffic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Away from the crowds, I walked along the Barf-Andaz area, meaning âplace to throw snowâ. âHere in Masouleh, we shovel our snow onto the rooftop of the neighbour below us,â Mr Safayee had told me earlier that day, chuckling at my surprise. Because it is closest to the slope of the mountain, the 1-2m area at the back of each roof is the strongest part of the structure. This is where the shovelled snow is stored in the winter, thus minimising the chance of a roof collapse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made my way back down into the village towards the bazaar, a compact alley filled with shops selling handcrafted knives, mountain goat horns and an assortment of bracelets. Tourists perused the wares while locals went about their evening grocery shopping, stopping at vendors offering baked goods, dried fruit, homemade jam and mountain herbs such as chamomile and mint. I passed an elderly lady, who was winding yarn into the shape of a doll to add to the colourful bundle next to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWould you like a doll?â she asked as her fingers expertly twisted the yarn to form the shape of a head. She told me that after her daughters had moved to the city of Rasht 70km away, she now makes the dolls that she once made for her daughters for visitors. I politely declined, and she bid me farewell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I followed a stairway to the level above the bazaar, took a seat at a restaurant patio and ordered mirzah ghasemi, a flavourful Persian dish of squash, aubergine, garlic and egg served together like a stew. Here, I enjoyed an early dinner while the evening fog rolled in once more, permeating the streets and shrouding the village in mist.\r\n",

      "In 1985, Jorge Eckstein, long-time resident of Buenos Airesâ historical San Telmo neighbourhood, purchased an abandoned mansion near his home that he intended to transform into a restaurant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Built in 1830, the mansion was grand but dilapidated. It was what many Argentines refer to as a âcasa chorizoâ â so named because the rooms of the house are lined up in a row like a string of sausages, opening onto a series of side patios. Eckstein knew the house would need a lot of work; the walls were crumbling and the ground floor was covered in debris.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not long after Eckstein began to renovate, he noticed something unusual about the foundation of the house, and it wasnât long before one of the patios was sinking. It turned out that Eckstein had stumbled onto what would become one of the cityâs most important archaeological sites: a portal to an underground labyrinth.\r\n",

      "The idea of a mysterious underground world has long been a subject of interest and imagination in Buenos Aires. âThe old myths about the existence of a great swarm of tunnels under the city come back to life again and again,â said Ricardo Orsini, coordinator at the cityâs Interpretive Centre for Archaeology and Palaeontology.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Eckstein discovered the sinking patio, a team of archaeologists from the University of Buenos Aires investigated the buildingâs foundation to learn more about its history. The 20-room mansion had been abandoned in the late 1800s when its occupants fled from the deathly waves of yellow fever sweeping through the Argentine city. In the early 20th Century, the mansion served as tenement housing, but by the 1980s, it was abandoned once again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The decision to dig marked a dramatic change in our local concept of recovering the past\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The decision to dig under the whole building marked a dramatic change in our local concept of recovering the past,\" Eckstein said, \"because it revealed not only the past that appears on the surface, but the past that existed under all the buildings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under the house, the archaeological team discovered an unusual vaulted construction, which further excavations revealed as the roof of an underground tunnel. But a tunnel leading to where? And for what purpose? These were the questions the archaeologists explored as they uncovered almost 2km of subterranean passageways. Their research revealed that the old house sat on top of an intricate drainage system. It seemed that neighbourhood residents built the tunnels around 1780 to reroute a stream that caused flooding when it rained, bringing a flow of dirty water â including animal waste from farms on the outskirts of town â onto the city streets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Today, the mansion â now the El ZanjÃ³n de Granados museum â acts as the entryway to the refurbished tunnels while also housing exhibitions that showcase objects found during the excavation. Standing inside one of the tunnels, I wouldnât have guessed that these broad passageways were used for such a practical purpose. Theyâre eerily romantic; lined with exposed brick, theyâve been beautifully restored and illuminated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the discovery of the tunnels was a surprise to Eckstein, it wasnât news for some of San Telmoâs older residents. Several of his neighbours remembered when segments of the dried-out tunnels were still open; no-one seems to know when and why they were closed off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Until relatively recently, confirms Daniel SchÃ¡velzon â who led the excavation at El ZanjÃ³n de Granados and is now the founder and director of the cityâs Centre for Urban Archaeology â any knowledge about the cityâs underground passages was based on memory and word of mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSince I was a student, I was interested in the underground world,â SchÃ¡velzon told me. âBut everything I heard or read didnât make sense. It was all myth and fantasy. Nobody was doing serious work. Later, when I was working in the field of urban archaeology, I myself became seriously involved in the subject. And I found underground constructions of all kinds. Itâs fascinating.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Founded in 1536, San Telmo is the oldest part of the original settlement of Buenos Aires, and itâs here that many of the cityâs underground tunnels are concentrated. But not all the tunnels were built for plumbing purposes. More than a century before the residents of San Telmo rerouted a stream, Jesuit priests were busy at work on another set of tunnels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the late 16th Century, a Jesuit order from Spain settled in Buenos Aires with the intention of spreading Christianity to the New World. They established a mission consisting of a church, a museum, a library and even a pharmacy â a complex known today as the Manzana de las Luces (Block of Enlightenment).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the Jesuits werenât exactly welcome in their new home â the regionâs indigenous populations strongly resisted the priestsâ attempts to convert them to Christianity. As conflict brewed, the Jesuits took steps to ensure their safety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was meant to be a secret\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According to SchÃ¡velzonâs research, the tunnels beneath the Manzana de las Luces were likely one part of a much larger (and unfinished) plan to connect the cityâs churches to allow priests and their congregations to escape in the event of an attack. âIt was a defensive project,â SchÃ¡velzon explained, âsimilar to what weâve seen in Lima [Peru] and in other cities in which thereâs no fort, no walls or cliffs. In case of an attack, the only way out is an underground escape.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even the experts donât know the extent of the Jesuitsâ network. In 1767, after failing to convert the indigenous population, the Jesuits abandoned their mission in Buenos Aires, heading inland to establish other missions near the border of Paraguay. The Spanish colonists who remained repurposed the mission buildings for their own use, establishing the Royal College of San Carlos and Argentinaâs first national library in their place (both establishments are no longer here). And the Jesuits didnât leave behind blueprints. âThere is very little written documentation,â SchÃ¡velzon told me. âIt was meant to be a secret.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jesuit tunnels remained hidden for nearly 150 years, until 1912, when, amid renovations for an architectural school that was operating inside the Manzana de las Luces complex, the floor started collapsing beneath workersâ feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A small section of the tunnel is accessible to the public on a guided tour. In comparison to the spacious tunnels beneath El ZanjÃ³n de Granados, the narrow, stone Jesuit tunnels feel rudimentary. Visitors walk single file through the dimly lit passageway, stooping to avoid bumping their heads on the low-arching ceilings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The losses weâve suffered are irreversible\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While some experts believe the passageways beneath El ZanjÃ³n de Granados and Manzana de las Luces were once a part of a more extensive tunnel system, the theory is hard to prove. If a larger network existed, much of it has been lost to time. In recent decades, construction crews working on unrelated projects, like the expansion of the subway, have uncovered, and bulldozed through, subterranean structures that could have been part of that larger network.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âUnfortunately,â Orsini said, âarchaeology did not always arrive in time to study all these architectural structures built underground. This is a metropolis in permanent development, and for a long time we lacked a legal framework to protect and preserve our archaeological heritage.â A remedial law passed in 2003 helped, âbut the losses weâve suffered are irreversible,â he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mysteries surrounding the tunnels continue to fascinate the public, and stories of undiscovered tunnels still pop up in the news from time to time: in 2000, long-time professors at Fernando Fader Technical School, located in the Flores neighbourhood 9km west of the Manzana de las Luces, recalled an old tunnel that once connected the buildingâs basement to the nearby Flores train station. An archaeological team found an underground chamber, but no tunnel. Yet to this day, the professors insist that it existed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Archaeology is the study of human history. But human recollection is part of the record, too. When the tunnels beneath El ZanjÃ³n de Granados were discovered, an elderly neighbour named Anastasio expressed delight, but not surprise. He said he always knew about the tunnels: he used to play in them as a child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Madfouna â a stuffed flatbread prepared using a handful of staple ingredients â is traditionally baked in a fire pit in the sand or a mud oven, and has long served as a wholesome meal for many nomadic families who live on the fringes of the Erg Chebbi dunes near the Algerian border. Once baked, the bread so closely resembles a pizza that it is locally nicknamed âthe Berber pizzaâ.\n",

Here, on the southern slopes of Bale Mountains National Park in south-east Ethiopia, hand-carved beehives are placed high in the tree canopies. Reaching them to retrieve the sweet, sticky nectar is arduous â and often dangerous.\r\n",

      "The Harenna Forest is straight out of a childrenâs storybook. Giant heather and fig trees, elegantly clothed in emerald moss, stretch out their branches as though frozen mid-dance. Black-maned lions roam the area, which is also home to olive baboons, warthogs and endangered Bale monkeys. On our walk, a white-cheeked turaco fixed us with its orange-rimmed eye, striking against pickle-green plumage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Said began preparations, gathering handfuls of moss and lichen, wrapping the bundle with twine and lighting it to create a glowing bouquet for smoking out the bees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A curious colobus monkey watched nearby as Said scaled the Hagenia abyssinica, a native tree whose sturdy branches and vast, umbrella-shaped crown provides a secure, sheltered home for the hives. He was barefoot and equipped with a single rope â a luxury not all local beekeepers can afford.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shimmied up a few metres at a time, pausing every few minutes to loop the rope higher up the broad trunk. The hive was around 20m above the ground. Finally, straddling a branch, he inched towards it and blew smoke from his mossy torch into a tiny hole in the hive, releasing a flurry of glowing embers into the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Said is one of a handful of beekeepers to still use this ancient method of beekeeping. While other parts of Ethiopia are moving to more modern production, the 600 families of the Harenna Forest are reluctant to abandon techniques honed over generations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their hives are made from the hollowed-out trunks of dead trees, carved in two canoe shapes and woven together with strips of bamboo. Before being suspended in the treetops, they are smoked over a fire stoked with beeswax and moss, infusing them with an aroma that attracts the queen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Timing is everything\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It takes three days to make a hive, and two people to winch it high in the trees. Once there, each can last up to eight years, yielding around 5kg of honey each biannual harvest, usually June and December.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After smoking out the swarm, beekeepers reach inside to retrieve the combs, squeezing the golden liquid into toughened leather pouches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Timing is everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Minutes after reaching the hive, Said released a sharp yelp. Within seconds, heâd slithered down the trunk and was back on the ground. It was too early. A relatively cool summer had delayed hatching, and baby bees â or ichs â were still curled in the honeycombs. The nibi, or adult bees, were angry. They continued attacking as Said stumbled away from the tree, shielding his face with a gossamer-thin scarf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBeekeepers often canât collect [the honey], and then they have to wait for the right moment to go back up,â Ziyad explained patiently, painstakingly plucking bees from Saidâs hair and clothes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stings might be common, Said added, but this time heâd been assailed by âmore than 100 beesâ. This had happened just twice in his 10 years as a beekeeper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With 70 hives clustered in this spot of the forest, Said comes from a line of beekeepers stretching back more than a century. Honey is the second biggest source of income after coffee, which grows wild here. They sell tubs of honey at local markets, keeping some for tej, a mead brewed with freshly harvested honey, water and gesho, a native species of buckthorn used to balance the sweetness with subtle, earthy spices. Every family has its own recipe, bringing out gourds of the wine on special occasions. No celebration is complete without tej.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leaving a forlorn Said by his hut, we trekked back to Bale Mountain Lodge, whose thatched chalets are dotted about the Katcha clearing, overlooked by Mount Gujuralli.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGenerations have been making honey like that,â Guy Levene, who co-owns the lodge with wife Yvonne, told me. The lodge organises tours to see the honey harvest and is keen to help the Harenna beekeepers earn more money from their craft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Levene has even been looking into ways to sell the delicately flavoured syrup abroad, while Slow Food Foundation â an offshoot of Italyâs Slow Food Movement â works with beekeepers in pockets of Ethiopia to help increase production, providing bigger, grounded hives and modern machinery to extract honey from the comb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here in Harenna, however, beekeepers are reluctant to abandon generations of tradition, no matter how labour intensive, and hazardous, it might be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is method in the madness. Placing the intricate hives high atop trees increases the beesâ chances of finding them as they zigzag through the forest. The height also creates distance from creatures that might disturb the hives and snaffle the contents, such as snuffling honey badgers. A few trees wear scraps of metal, like armour, for extra protection from tree-climbing bandits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honey trickles through centuries of culture and religion\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But itâs not just about practicality, or even profit. In Ethiopia, honey trickles through centuries of culture and religion. It features in 4th-Century Christian frescoes and tapestries, where saints are seen clutching bereles, the traditional fat-bottomed flasks used for serving tej. Lalibela, the town 1,100km north of the Bale Mountains thatâs famous for its 13th-Century monolithic churches, even translates as âhoney eaterâ. Itâs named after King Lalibela who, according to legend, was swarmed by bees as a newborn, miraculously emerging unscathed. His mother named him Lalibela, declaring the bees had recognised him as a ruler.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honey here is healing, even spiritual. Folklore says that bees constructed hives â chewing wax until soft, then bonding it to create honeycomb cells â in the windows of Lalibelaâs earliest churches before the first congregation in 488AD. They still produce âholy honeyâ or mar, reserved only for healing â applied topically to treat skin diseases or, for internal illnesses, eaten by the spoonful or imbibed with holy water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the Bale Mountains, honey is both part of everyday life and a symbol of social status. Families with larger numbers of beehives and a higher yield of honey are held in high regard. Ownership is sacred, and theft of other beekeepersâ honey or hives is rare: if caught, the culprit is shunned by his neighbours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spoonfuls are taken in the morning, the antibiotic properties believed to ward off illness and soothe the soul. Bees pollinate up to 20 different plants, resulting in a complex, perfumed honey. Nectar gathered from Hagenia trees, whose dusky pink blooms are brewed into a tea to treat tapeworm, adds medicinal value.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day after the harvest, guide Ziyad took me to his village, Rira, a brief but bumpy drive along pot-holed paths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Slow Food Foundation formed a beekeepersâ cooperative here in 2014, aiming to refine the honey collection and packaging process so a more sophisticated product can be brought to market. Itâs a slow process. As in the Harenna Forest, Riraâs beekeepers are attached to traditional methods. Many families have hung their hives in the same trees for several generations. For now, the priority is providing and encouraging the use of protective clothing and equipment, to at least minimise the risk of injury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the tiny village, we sat on plastic chairs surrounded by teardrop-shaped huts cladded with mud and woven with straw, as plates appeared from a tiny kitchen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally, I got to taste the dark amber honey â creamy, fruity and floral, with a whisper of smoke â mopped up with ambasha flatbread. Groups of children sat nearby, devouring the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Honey and bread is a regular after-school snack, Ziyad explained. Leftover bread is chopped up and mixed with more honey, then eaten in bowlfuls for breakfast.\r\n",

      "\"There have been hundreds of such studies, in most countries in the world, over the last 30 years,\" said Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London. \"They are funded by national governments, following strict ethical review, to understand the impact of emissions on human health.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "One unusual aspect of the VW testing, according to both Dr Kelly and Dr Carlsten, was the use of monkeys. According to the New York Times, 10 cynomolgus macaque monkeys, a breed used extensively in medical experiments, were put in chambers and played cartoons to distract them while diesel fumes were pumped in.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But it was the funding and commissioning of tests by the motor industry itself that was the significant controversy, both professors said. The work was commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, a car lobby group funded by the VW, BMW and Daimler car manufacturers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kinds of studies undertaken by Dr Kelly and Dr Carlsten are independently funded, peer-reviewed and published.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A good analogy would be allowing tobacco companies to sponsor research on the effects of smoking, keep the results secret, and simply publishing a press release that suited them, said Dr Kelly.\r\n",

      "In 2007, Artigas was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, which caused his kidney function to decline rapidly. By 2014, he required haemodialysis treatment three times a week to do the work his kidneys no longer could. Each dialysis session - during which his blood would pass through an external waste-removing filtration machine before returning to his body - took four hours.\r\n",

      "For patients like Artigas, their dialysis sessions need to be set in stone to prevent dangerous toxins from building up in the blood. Regular appointments cannot be missed, so visiting a foreign country where you may not speak the language, understand medical regulations, or be able to find affordable treatment, is a huge challenge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I had four children and I didn't know what to do,\" he says. \"Nobody was going to hire me. To be unemployed was a whole unknown world for me. I went into a crisis because I was my family's breadwinner - a deep emotional crisis.\"\r\n",

On one occasion he was sent to CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, where he had arranged a dialysis session, but when he arrived he was told that there was no record of his appointment. He had no access to the vital treatment he needed because he wasn't a resident of Argentina.\r\n",

This was a big success, but the breakthrough that enabled Artigas to expand the project to serve people in nearly 150 countries, providing access to more than 14,500 dialysis machines, came about in the most unexpected way - as a result of HernÃ¡n Casciari's Airbnb review.\r\n",

      "1. Bioluminescence makes the sea shimmer\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may have seen the pictures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Itâs night-time in an impossibly exotic location. Waves are breaking on the beach. The water is sparkling with electric blue lights.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The internet loves an image of a magical-looking bioluminescent bay. You may also have seen travel bloggers bemoaning the real event as not quite living up the hype.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even if the latter is true, bioluminescence (in this case usually caused by planktonic organisms called dinoflagellates) is a pretty amazing natural phenomenon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dinoflagellates emit blue light when disturbed, which is why they can be seen sparkling over wave crests, around boats or when a hand or paddle runs through them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These tiny creatures are the most common source of bioluminescence at the oceanâs surface.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So-called bioluminescent bays such as in Puerto Rico and Jamaica are among the best-known places to witness the glow. However, the ephemeral phenomenon can be found throughout the ocean where there are dense gatherings of dinoflagellates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes dinoflagellatesâ population increases rapidly causing blooms, which by day are coloured a less attractive red-brown, sometimes known as red tides. And some, but not all, of these red tides are poisonous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even stranger and rarer than bioluminescent bays are âmilky seasâ, where continually glowing water stretches for as far as the eye can see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milky seas have only been seen a few hundred times since 1915, mainly concentrated around north-western Indian Ocean and near Java, Indonesia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They are not caused by dinoflagellates, but are thought to be the result of âbioluminescent bacteria that have accumulated in large numbers near the surfaceâ, explains to Dr Matt Davis, Assistant Professor of Biology, St. Cloud State University in the US, who specialises in bioluminescence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reports by sailors over the centuries have described milky seas as a nocturnal whitish glow like a field of snow, but scientists have had little chance to investigate the phenomenon first-hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In 2005, researchers analysing archived satellite images found that milky seas could be seen from space and that one satellite had captured images of a huge area of ocean that had displayed the strange glow for three consecutive nights a decade earlier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. Animals glow in the dark\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bioluminescence, the emission of visible light by an organism as the result of a natural chemical reaction, is common among marine life such as fishes, squid and molluscs. In the deep sea most species are bioluminescent, where it is the main source of light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In shallower waters, most bioluminescent fish display their lights at night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFlashlight fishes have a specialized pouch under their eye that they can rotate to expose the light emitted from these bacteria, and they use this glow at night to hunt for food and communicate,â says Dr Matt Davis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ponyfish emit light from the bioluminescent bacteria housed in a pouch using transparent muscular shutters, to communicate, he explains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Camouflage, defence and predation are among the variety of reasons fishes are thought to emit light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For example, bobtail squid have an ingenious way of using lights. These nocturnal animals have a mutually beneficial relationship with luminescing bacteria that live in a mantel cavity on its underside. At night the squid control the intensity of this light to match the moonlight, and can reduce their silhouette to camouflage themselves from predators.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. Moonlight triggers the planetâs biggest orgy\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is nothing more romantic than a moonlit night, especially if you are a coral on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night a year in spring, the biggest orgy on earth is triggered by lunar light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over 130 coral species simultaneously release their eggs and sperm into the water during a window of just 30-60 minutes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This mass spawning event might be the most extraordinary example of synchronised behaviour in the natural world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the gametes â eggs and sperm cells - are released they hover for a moment, forming a ghostly replica of the reefâs shape, before dispersing into an underwater blizzard as the sperm fertilise the eggs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr Oren Levy, a marine biologist and ecologist and Professor of Life Sciences at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, has studied this extraordinary event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis is really fascinating phenomenaâ¦we know this event is going to happen a few nights after November's full moon each year, three to five [days] post full moon,â he says.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "â[It is] always amazing, in particular I am so amazed how each of the coral species year after year spawn at the same hour of the night.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He adds: âOnce it happens it is always so exciting to see how everything is becoming so live and synchronised. It is almost [a] spiritual event and you understand the power of nature in its best.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moonlight triggers the phenomenon by acting as a synchroniser or âalarmâ probably with other environmental signals such as sunset timings, water temperature and tides to cue the time of the gamete [egg and sperm cells] release, explains Dr Levy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He adds that corals seem to possess photoreceptors that detect the phases of the moon, which helps with the âfine tuningâ of the gamete release.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. Sharks and seals rely on celestial light\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some seals, moonlit nights spell danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During winter months, the 60,000 cape fur seals on Sea Island in False Bay, South Africa run the gauntlet of being picked off by great white sharks patrolling the seas when they enter and exit the water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One study in 2016 hypothesised seals swimming at night during a full moon are at more risk of being eaten by a shark since bright moonlight silhouetting them against the surface makes them an easy meal for predators lurking below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, most shark attacks on seals happen just after sunrise. Researchers behind the study, which measured shark attacks at dawn, were surprised to find seals were much less likely to be predated at this time of day if there was a full moon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The researchers theorised that lunar illumination combined with emerging sunlight may decrease the stealth ability of the sharks and that the advantage switched from sharks to seals as night turned to day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And seals may rely on another celestial feature to navigate - the stars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are able to locate a single lodestar and steer by it, researchers have shown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During a test using a simulated night sky, seals swam towards the brightest star and could orientate themselves when the stars were swivelled around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the wild, seals need to navigate the open ocean to find foraging grounds that may be separated by hundreds of kilometres.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Researcher Dr Bjorn Mauck said at the time: \"Seals might learn the position of the stars relative to foraging grounds during dawn and dusk when they can see both the stars and landmarks at the coast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5. Strange animals come to the surface every night\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under the cover of darkness rarely seen creatures migrate to the oceanâs surface to feed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Humboldt squid, also known as the jumbo squid, is one of the most eye-catching marine animals you can see lurking in surface waters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By day the squid lurk in the deep waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean along the deep shelf that runs off the west coast of the Americas and every night they are one of the many ocean animals to migrate upwards to find dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Vertical (or diel) migration - when ocean animals swim to the surface at dusk and disappear down again at dawn â is extremely common.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat [Humbioldt squid are] doing largely is following their main food item, which is the so-called lantern fish,â explains Professor Paul Rodhouse, an Emeritus Fellow for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and former head of the organisationâs biological sciences division.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In turn, lantern fish follow vertically migrating zooplankton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since zooplankton are depended on by so many ocean animals, âthe rest of the food chain will be following on after it,â says Prof Rodhouse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is a huge movement of biomass every day,â says Prof Rodhouse. âMore than a thousand metres. Some of the oceanic squid probably migrate over 1000m every day.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He adds that almost all pelagic species (animals that live in the water column not near the bottom or shore) that can swim make the journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Humboldt squid are among the most striking creatures to surface every night. Their ability to change colour and flash bright red when agitated has earned them the nickname âred devilsâ. Although much smaller than their cousin, the 13m-giant squid, they can reach a length of about 1.5m (almost 5ft). Highly aggressive predators, they capture prey with strong tentacles and suckers and tear into it with powerful beaks, and have reportedly occasionally attacked humans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even ferocious Humboldts are preyed upon by bigger predators such as billfish, swordfish and sharks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOf course what they are all doing [by being active at night] is avoiding predation by the top predators,â says Prof Rodhouse. \"The big predators that are visual predators and which stay in the surface waters and see their prey.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo theyâre allâ¦ reducing the risk of being preyed on by going down into deep, dark waters at night.â\r\n",

      "\"I'm not sure if I have surfed the perfect wave yet. I'm still searching,\" says Jamie Mitchell, World Surf League Big Wave Tour surfer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From highly skilled professional athletes to hobbyists after the rush of the open waves, surfing is enjoyed by people from all walks of life, from all over the planet. All you need is ocean (but not always), a board of some kind, waves, and a lot of enthusiasm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the tricks and twists of seasoned professionals amaze us, below the surface lies a raft of surfing science as impressive as the feats performed on the waves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One wave could power over 30 million smartphones\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anyone who has watched waves crashing will have a sense of their enormous power and it is this power that may prove to be one of the most promising sources for renewable energy; potentially supplying 10% of global needs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Waves are formed in a number of ways, but in most cases they are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. As long as the wave travels forward slower than the speed of the wind, energy will be transferred from the wind to the wave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are clever and complicated equations that can accurately determine the amount of energy in a wave, but to put it simply the bigger the wave, the bigger the power and there are few places on Earth where the waves are as big as they are at Nazare in Portugal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These monster Portuguese waves can reach epic proportions of over 100ft (30.5m) thanks to a combination of the location of the coast and the unique undersea features. Waves generated by storms in the North Atlantic are focused by a deep, arrow-shaped canyon 16,000ft (4877m) below the ocean's surface; these deep water waves then approach the shallow waters of the shore and start to climb up, meaning the waves at Nazare can get big. Real big!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nazare is like a 7th wonder of the World,\" says Mitchell (who is the defending Nazare Challenge winner).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour. You sort of feel like you're back in the day of the gladiators when the world is watching and you're trying to survive and perform at the same time,\" he says.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Imagine the energy in a wave that stands as tall as an eight-storey building. It is estimated some of the waves at Nazare hold enough energy to power over 30 million smartphone batteries. It could be the ideal location for wave energy farms to harvest all that untapped power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Waves hide amazing secrets\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aside from Nazare, there are a few other âbig waveâ spots around the world where the perfect conditions come together to create the kind of waves that surfers dream of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "TeahupoÊ»o village on the south-west coast of Tahiti is one such place. The waves here are big and steep and with the very real threat of falling onto its razor-sharp reef it has attracted the worldâs best and bravest (perhaps craziest) surfers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waves at TeahupoÊ»o are what scientists call âsurging wavesâ; they arenât the tallest (the biggest waves are about 30ft / 9.1m high), but they are super thick, formed when deep water suddenly meets a shallow sharp shoreline.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tahiti is a volcanic island and its rapidly growing reef creates a steep break (the point where the top of the wave starts to overtake the bottom causing it to spill over). This should result in large, uneven waves, but the waves at TeahupoÊ»o are unique and it's all down to geology.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fresh water running down from Tahiti's mountainous region creates channels in the ocean floor where coral cannot grow. These channels funnel water from the shore back into the deeper ocean, creating clean waves and a fast current.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On top of this, the water coming through the channels builds up the thickness of the wave, making it look like the ocean is rising up, rather than a normal waveâs ripple. The shore is extremely steep and the coral canât grow too deep leading to a more gradual wave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of these conditions come together to create a wave so intense TeahupoÊ»o is known as one of the best and most unique âbig waveâ surfing spots on the planet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Surfers can travel faster than city traffic\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Driving through a city can be painfully slow at times, particularly during rush hour. So itâll come as no surprise that average vehicle speed in Europeâs most congested cities is only around 30km per hour (18.6mph), with London faring particularly badly at 19km per hour (11.8mph); a horse-drawn carriage could almost match this speed!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was during the 2011 World Surf Leagueâs World Tour circuit in Australia that professional surfer Mick Fanning (nicknamed White Lightning) had his speed measured at an impressive 39.1km per hour (24.3mph); almost 10km per hour faster than you could drive around a city.\r\n",

      "Found on the underside of a surfboard, fins are critical to the stability, feel and control of the board. Traditionally, fins were rigid and made of wood, but advances in plastics and composite materials have produced fins that allow for greater control while turning on a wave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it seems the future is in fins that mimic whale flippers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whales may be massive, but they are also graceful, and it is their ingenious flippers that help them stay so nimble. Their fins allow them to perform some impressive underwater acrobatics, especially in their tight, controlled turns.\r\n",

It also flexes from the base to the tip, like conventional fins do, creating more speed in the turn as the flexing fin snaps back into place.\r\n",

Importantly, it is not performed when the animal is threatened or competing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Equally it could also be that using the power of the waves is a more energy efficient way of travelling than swimming underwater. The impact of entering the waves might help to dislodge parasites on the skin, or the splashing noise it makes could also be a signal or communication to other dolphins in the area. There may also be free food when done alongside a fishing vessel, and when done in groups it may teach social bonding.\r\n",

      "Weâve all heard of squid and octopus using pigments to blend in with their surroundings, but what about becoming completely invisible? To become actually see through, and appear as if you arenât there, you need to either allow light to travel through you unimpeded, or bend light around you - so that none reflects back at an observer. Itâs a tricky task, but some animals are almost there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glass octopus\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the ocean animals have two choices if they want to hide. Creatures that live in the deep ocean close to the seafloor can blend in with sand or rocks, or hide in coral. In the deep ocean it is often pitch black anyway and predators lack eyes, so being invisible is not necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Animals that live close to the surface and want to hide can produce dazzling displays of light in a process known as bioluminescence, confusing predators below who think they are looking at dappled sunshine hitting the waterâs surface. Animals that live in midwater though have neither of these options. This region is known as the pelagic zone, and it also happens to be where most invisible animals live.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the easiest way of becoming invisible is by being transparent and letting light travel completely through you. In open oceans, which lack structures to hide behind, being transparent is a great way of hiding from all viewpoints and angles. Itâs so popular in fact that transparency has independently evolved multiple times in completely unrelated animals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One such animal, the glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) is so named because it is almost completely transparent. The gelatinous creature can grow up to 45cm (18in), if you include the tentacles. It lives 300-1000m below the surface in tropical and subtropical waters across the world, and is almost completely invisible to predators except for its digestive system, optic nerves and eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But whatâs the point in making your whole body transparent, if the eyes and guts are still visible? Even worse, these organs will cast shadows on the seafloor below, making them more visible to predators. Eyes need to absorb light to function, so it is not possible for them to be transparent. Guts betray their contents, so unless an animal feeds on transparent material, they will be visible. However the octopus, and all hosts of transparent creatures go to great lengths to disguise these opaque organs. The glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) for example has very elongated eyes which reduces its peripheral vision, but minimises the shadow it casts below - making it less likely to be detected by predators hunting from below. There is also some evidence that it orientates its body in such a way so as to minimise its shadow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The glass octopus is not the only transparent animal to come up with an ingenious way of disguising its eyes. Many transparent molluscs camouflage their eyes with mirrors, as mirrors in the open ocean reflect only more ocean and so are invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranchiidae or glass squid\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The glass family of squid, of which there are about 60 species, are almost entirely see through. They live, again in the pelagic region of oceans around the world, between 200 and 1000m below sea level.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although their bodies are entirely transparent, their large eyes are opaque, which is a problem as predators swimming below can easily see the shadow they cast. However the glass squid (Cranchiidae) uses a clever form of camouflage to hide them. It uses photophores - organs beneath its eyes - to produce light in a trick called counter-illumination. This light looks very similar to the sunlight filtering down from above, so it makes the squid completely invisible to predators swimming below it. However the light could make the squid very conspicuous to viewers looking at it from other angles. Rather than an invisibility cloak, the glowing light could act like a beacon drawing predators to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that the squidâs photophores are amazingly able to match the amount of light they produce to that coming in from every direction, creating a sort of omnidirectional invisibility cloak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tomopteris deep sea worm\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This genus, or group of marine planktonic polychaete worms are almost completely transparent, making them very difficult for predators to see. Paradoxically at least 11 species in the group can also emit bright luminous colours. Most tomopteris worms glow blue, but one species, Tomopteris nisseni can produce yellow light and is one of only few such creatures on the planet to do so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some tomopteris worms can even distract predators by releasing a glowing part of their body called a parapodia, making the predator chase after the dispelled body part rather than the worm itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sea salp\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A salp is a completely transparent barrel shaped creature which swims and feeds at the same time by pumping water through its gelatinous body. They filter out the phytoplankton in the water to feed on. Although they look a bit like jellyfish they are actually more sophisticated and are closely related to fish and vertebrates - they have a heart and gills and can reproduce sexually.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Salps have a fascinating life cycle. For part of it they live by themselves, but they then clone themselves and form long strings and other shapes of connected organisms. Individual salps synchronise their swimming by communicating with one another via electrical signals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hyperiids\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes being transparent isnât enough, and organisms need other tricks up their sleeve to remain invisible. This is certainly the case for the Hyperiid, a little crustacean bearing a resemblance to a shrimp. They are able to hide from predators by being transparent. However that only gets them so far. A plane of glass is also transparent but you can still see it if you shine a light on it, as the light is reflected back. This is a particular problem in the ocean because many predators use bioluminescence as a searchlight when hunting for prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A recent study suggests there is more to the hyperiidâs ability to hide than simple transparency. It turns out they are using a kind of nanotechnology to interfere with and bend light, cloaking themselves and almost rendering them invisible. The scientists used a scanning electron microscope to closely analyse seven species of hyperiids. They found that the legs of one species were covered in tiny nano sized hair-like protuberances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The body of this species, and six others were also covered in nano sized bumps or spheres ranging in size from under 100 nanometers to around 300 nanometers. The tiny size of the bumps could minimise light scattering and the scientists found that a combination of both nanostructures - the bumps and the hairs could reduce reflectance by as much as 100 fold. The weird thing is that the researchers think these spheres could actually be bacteria.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The squid Japetella heathi and the octopus Onychoteuthis banksii also have a novel trick up their sleeves when it comes to invisibility - they can quickly switch from being transparent to a reddish brown colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They both live in the Pacific Ocean between 600-1000m deep â known as the mesopelagic zone. Although being transparent helps a lot with invisibility close to the waterâs surface, as diffuse sunlight from the surface passes straight through transparent tissue, when you shine a light directly on something that is transparent, it suddenly becomes very visible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unfortunately this happens quite a lot in the deep sea, where predators use light-emitting organs called photophores like a searchlight when hunting. Prey at these depths are often red or black so that they reflect as little blue light as possible. Japetella heathi, an octopus, and Onychoteuthis banksii, a squid, are able to switch between both, but how do they do it? Both speciesâ skin contains light sensitive cells called chromatophores. The cells contain a dye, and when they detect light they immediately expand and release the pigment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sea Sapphires\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sea Sapphires (Sapphirina) are ant size creatures that live in warm tropical and subtropical seas. They belong to a group of crustaceans called copepods. Different species emit a range of brilliant iridescent colours, from vivid blues to reds and golds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What is remarkable about them is that one second they can shimmer brightly and the next they appear almost to disappear and the way they do this is fascinating. Their skin, or cuticle cells contain tiny crystal plates arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern. The crystals contain guanine, one of the four bases that make up DNA. The crystal layers are separated from each other by a soup-like fluid called a cytosol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A team of scientists found that the although the layers of guanine crystals are always exactly the same thickness â 70 nanometers, the thickness of the cytosol between the layers varies from 50 to 200 nanometers. It is this variety which determines the colour of the sea sapphire. Thicker layers of cytosol lead to longer wavelengths of light being reflected, which make the copepod look red or magenta.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colour also depends on the angle of light which strikes them. As the angle becomes smaller and smaller, the wavelength of reflected light becomes shorter and the colour more violet. If the angle becomes small enough then the reflected light is in the UV spectrum, which means that we canât see it and the sea sapphires disappear. The researchers found that light which hit the crustaceans at a 45Â° angle effectively caused them to become invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The glasswing butterfly\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of the transparent animals discussed so far have lived in the sea, and thereâs a good reason for that. To be transparent you need to be made up of stuff that neither absorbs nor reflects light. This is a difficult task for plants and animals that live on land because there is such a large difference between the refractive index of living tissues and air. The refractive index of a material describes how quickly light travels through it. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, and generally speaking the denser a material, the longer light takes to travel through it and the greater its refractive index will be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As biological tissue is so much thicker and denser than air, when light waves go from travelling through air to body tissue, they slow down. This causes light to change directions and scatter, causing reflections that make the animal more visible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the sea there is less difference between the refractive index of water and biological tissues, so transparency is an easier task, hence why there are so many âalmostâ invisible animals. Another reason you donât find many see through animals on land is because organisms need pigments like melanin to protect them from UV radiation from the sun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However there are some exceptions to the see through rule. One is the glasswing butterfly (Greta oto) which lives in Central America.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although not all of its body is see through, its transparent wings make it difficult for predators to track it during flight. To look at how the butterfly achieves its transparency, scientists examined their wings under an electron microscope. They found tiny nano sized bumps called nanopillars which were scattered randomly and had different lengths. It seems that the random size and distribution of the nanoscale structures help the butterfly minimise reflections from its wings. The nanopillars interfere with rays of light hitting the wing, causing most to pass straight through rather than bouncing back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Transparent mollusc\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another exception to the rule is a translucent snail (Zospeum tholussum) that was discovered in the deepest cave in Croatia. Scientists from Goethe University, Frankfurt found the see through mollusc living 980m underground in the Lukina Jama-Trojama cave, in a chamber full of rocks and sand with a small stream running through it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The snail belongs to a genus of miniature land snails that are found in dark, underground caves, and which are unable to move by themselves. Researchers believe they use running water from streams to transport themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However even though it is translucent, the snail is still fairly visible, highlighting just how difficult it is for land animals to achieve what those in the ocean do.\r\n",

      "To help stranded sea otters, they have an Intensive Care Unit and multiple enclosures filled with filtered seawater with the capacity to hold 10 animals at one time. To monitor their progress once back in the wild, they use radio transmitters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe implant the transmitters so that we can track each otter and watch its behaviour following release,â he says.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Not all approaches to conservation are so well funded, but this doesnât mean they are any less successful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana) is one of the rarest and most endangered species of otter. In the 1990s, it was thought extinct throughout its range in Southeast Asia due to habitat loss, poaching, local consumption of otter meat and a loss of its sources of food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, surveying between 2006 and 2013 at possible habitats confirmed the presence of several small populations. In Cambodia, for example, it was found in four areas; one of the largest populations being around the flooded forest surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the species has been ârediscoveredâ, it needs to be protected so that the populations can be allowed to grow. And thatâs where organisations such as Conservation International have worked to protect and conserve the area and the species.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Sokrith Heng, Conservation Internationalâs lead researcher for the survey, explains, even though there are a number of laws and regulations to protect the species, enforcement on the ground is weak and limited and local peopleâs awareness of the importance of the wildlife and ecosystems they live in is very limited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poverty in areas such as rural Cambodia can also be a problem and often pushes local communities to use natural resources in unsustainable ways.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In response to this, Conservation International took action at Tonle Sap Lake. Their approach was to restore critical habitat, raise awareness in local communities and schools, and suggest laws and regulations to better protect the species. They also established conservation zones, protecting these through collaboration with government and community rangers as well as helping local community fisheries to development alternative livelihoods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Key to this was directly engaging local community members in otter research and forming a group of âotter ambassadorsâ who help spread awareness resulting in stronger support from locals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is important Heng says because; âEducating local people means they can share their knowledge to other community members.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An important part of the successful conservation here is ensuring that local communities are able to sustainably use and manage their resources, and that the communities are financially stronger, explains Heng. For example, some community fisheries now have better protection for the otters: they are patrolling the area to stop illegal activities and teaching otter conservation in the local area.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Tonle Sap Lake, these approaches resulted in fewer otter traps and skins being recorded by officials and researchers, both signs that fewer animals were being killed. While ongoing habitat restoration combined with less hunting and greater awareness is helping to ensure a brighter future for the hairy-nosed otter.\r\n",

      "Reputation: Dung beetles roll across the African savannah with big balls of, well, dung. The ancient Egyptians were really into them, for some reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reality: From South America to South Africa, the UK to the USA, they will be there. Not only are dung beetles a diverse and multifaceted group of insects, they keep our farmland fertile and our pests and parasites at bay, and even play a part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They do not all eat dung, either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dung beetle was an icon in ancient Egypt, adorning temples, jewellery and texts. It was the symbol of a god who rolled the Sun up over the horizon each day, just like an enormous ball of dung. To this day, this is the stereotypical dung beetle, the one made famous by natural history films â a stocky black insect, trundling along with its smelly ball.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I get that a lot,\" says insect ecologist Tomas Roslin at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, \"and then hurry to point out that there are as many different species of beetles living in dung as there are, for example, bird species globally\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sacred scarab of Egypt is a real animal, but it is just the tip of the dung heap. Dung beetles can be big or small, adorned with beautiful colours or horns to fight opponents, and inhabit chilly grasslands or tropical rainforests. Of the thousands of dung beetle species, only a fraction actually roll their dung into balls, and many do not eat dung at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With so many different species that exist globally, the differences in life history are almost endless,\" says Trond Larsen, a tropical ecologist and Director of Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program. \"Among the most fascinating dung beetle species are those which have developed unusual specialisations.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most dung beetles work hard to live up to their name. In their quest for dung, some species engage in epic kung fu battles on the savannah. Others take up residence by monkeys' anuses, so they can hop onto the dung as it leaves its owner: a perfect example of \"first come, first serve\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But according to Larsen, it is common to find over 150 distinct dung beetle species at a single site in the tropics. With this level of competition for limited quantities of dung, it is hardly surprising that some have evolved non dung-based diets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These diets would still not be to everyone's taste. Whether it is carrion, rotting fruit and fungi, or dead invertebrates, dung beetles seem happy to serve as nature's bin men, hoovering up unpleasant detritus and waste. One species lives on the backs of giant land snails, sucking up their mucus while enjoying a free ride.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the most fascinating specialists are the dung beetles that have made the switch from dung to hunting prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Predatory dung beetles have long been alluded to in the scientific literature. One species from Brazil was recorded decapitating large ants, before leaving their heads behind and rolling the fat abdomens into an underground lair â as if they were balls of dung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most of all, though, some dung beetles really seem to have it in for millipedes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aware of reports that certain beetles attack live millipedes, Larsen decided to go in search of the killer. After identifying a likely Peruvian species called Deltochilum valgum, he captured some specimens to observe their behaviour. \"I was amazed to unravel the highly detailed attack strategies employed by the beetles,\" he enthuses. Once again, decapitation is their favoured mode of attack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, thanks to their family history of eating dung, these beetles lack the sharp mouthparts commonly found in carnivorous animals. Instead, they have to improvise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Successful decapitation of millipedes depends on a suite of morphological adaptations, such as the shape of the hind legs, the prying 'teeth' on the front of the head, and the narrow width of the head for fitting inside the millipede's body segments,\" says Larsen. Essentially, the dung beetles slowly prise their unfortunate prey's body apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Millipedes are commonplace and slow, making them the perfect prey for these makeshift predators. Larsen reckons the evolutionary leap from feeding on carrion and dead invertebrates to living millipedes is not huge, and predicts that other dung beetles will also make the switch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clarke Scholtz, a veteran entomologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, knows a thing or two about dung beetles. He says that millipede-eaters are also present across the Atlantic, and agrees that this lifestyle change is actually rather straightforward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Adult dung beetles are not dung feeders in the strictest sense of the word,\" says Scholtz. \"They feed on tiny particles of gut epithelium from whatever it was that produced the dung, bacteria, fungi and tiny fractions of dung.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, carrion-feeding dung beetles, and those feeding on invertebrates, are slurping on smoothies of juices and insides, filtering out the nutritious particles just as they would with dung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despite their forays into other foodstuffs, the primary business of the dung beetle family is still, well, \"business\". Whether they roll it around, bury it or live inside it, these beetles know their way around a pile of poop, and have done since the time of the dinosaurs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What's more, while they are not pushing the Sun across the sky, dung beetles are doing important work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dung beetles are an essential part of the ecosystem,\" says Bryony Sands of the University of Bristol, UK. \"In my opinion, they are as important as bees, but because of their unglamorous lifestyle their value is definitely overlooked.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Faeces are a fact of life, and without an efficient waste disposal system the world would quickly descend into a swamp of unprocessed sewage. Dung beetles are that system. \"The beetles process the dung by tunnelling, burying, and fragmenting it,\" says Sands. They lay their eggs in it, their larvae eat it, worms bury it further, and the circle of dung continues.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scholtz puts the situation into perspective. \"We have 15 million cattle in South Africa, and each produces about 12 cow pats per day,\" he says. \"That equates to about 5,500 tonnes of dung every day. We would all be knee deep â or shoulder deep â in it if it wasn't for dung beetles.\" And that is before we even consider the elephant dung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This whole process not only quickly and efficiently removes dung from the surface, it brings all those important nutrients back down into the soil, making the soil fertile and our pastures productive,\" says Sands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the UK, which is home to a mere 60 species of dung beetle compared to South Africa's 800, the ecosystem services provided by dung beetles could be saving the cattle industry Â£367 million each year. Comparable savings have been estimated in the USA. Not only are dung beetles boosting pasture fertility, they also disperse seeds, improve soil structure, and reduce the prevalence of pests and parasites that affect both humans and livestock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a 2016 study, Sands showed that dung beetles reduce the spread of intestinal worms in cattle. Unfortunately, the anti-worm drugs farmers give to their cattle come out in their dung, and that is bad news for the beetles. \"This is a bit of a catch-22,\" says Sands. \"The very chemicals that farmers are using to treat the gut worms are actually killing the dung beetles, which would be naturally reducing worm transmission on pasture, making the problem worse in the long run.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed, the tremendous value of dung beetles has not gone unnoticed. Some pioneering scientists have used them to orchestrate major ecological changes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The most dramatic instance of dung beetle intervention began in Australia in the 1960s, when the country was facing a dung disaster. Native dung beetles were used to the dry, hard dung of marsupials, not the sloppy pats left by introduced cattle. This led to farmlands covered with cow dung and bush fly swarms of biblical proportions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a bold move, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) established the Australian Dung Beetle Project. Over two decades, a team introduced 53 species of dung beetles from around the world. The foreign beetles were able to beat back the tide of manure, leading to a drop of about 90% in bush fly numbers. As a side note, it has been argued that the decline in flies has also saved the country's outdoor cafÃ©s from extinction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was the success of the project that it has been repeated both in Australia and in neighbouring New Zealand, and this is not the final word on dung beetle interventions. \"CSIRO and other Australian and New Zealand researchers have not concluded their efforts in the dung beetle space,\" says Patrick Gleeson, a research technician at CSIRO. He mentions a recent application to develop a new, national dung beetle project.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To add to a growing list of dung beetle powers, work by Roslin and his colleagues has also found evidence that dung beetles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We are talking fairly big effects, like a reduction of 40% of total methane emissions from any single dung pat inhabited by beetles,\" Roslin says. \"Dung beetle tunnels will serve as ventilation shafts, bringing oxygen into the pat. That will shift the balance between different microbes. Methane-producing microbes don't like oxygen.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When you consider the emissions from an entire food supply chain, Roslin says, the impact of beetles is relatively small. Nevertheless, this addition to dung beetles's CV is yet another reminder of their significance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Finland, where Roslin conducted his studies, the tiny beetles are a far cry from the ostentatious, mouse-sized creatures found in Africa. But they are still playing their role, epitomising the biologist E.O. Wilson's reference to \"the little things that run the world\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Remember, dung beetles are not just something you see struggling with balls of elephant dung on African savannahs,\" says Sands. \"They are right here at home on your doorstep, and they need to be looked after!\"\n",
      "Few things get the adrenalin spiking quite like a big brawl, even if you are just a popcorn-guzzling spectator. But if you want the real ultimate fighters you need to look to nature, where champions compete for more than glory: they fight to survive.\r\n",

      "The owners of possibly the fastest punch known to science are marine crustaceans called mantis shrimps. They use specialised forelimbs to strike prey with shocking power. The force is so great that the mantis shrimps tear through the water, creating small implosions that generate heat, light and sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some species have adapted specialised appendages to spear, like a harpoon, while others smash with a club. In captivity, they have been known to break aquarium glass with a single hit.\r\n",

      "Many social insects clash by knocking their antennae together\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sheila Patek's laboratory at Duke University in North Carolina specialises in studying fast animal movements. Patek's team has discovered that peacock mantis shrimps can generate a force peaking at nearly 2,500 times their body weight in less than 800 microseconds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Patek says springs, levers and latches are the key to this amazing ability. Within each mantis shrimp's appendage is a four-bar linkage system that manages force. One link pushes against the next, building up energy before it is unleashed through the harpoon or club segment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Much like an archer, the mantis shrimp stores up elastic energy in advance of the strike and releases it with a latch,\" says Patek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shrimps also engage in territorial contests. However, Patek and colleagues describe these encounters as \"ritualised sparring\" rather than lethal contests. Competing shrimps first size each other up, and only come to blows as a last resort. On the rare occasions that they physically fight, the shrimps first curl up their armoured tailplates, or telsons, to shield their abdomens. The winner is the shrimp that, like Rocky Balboa, can withstand the most hits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Many social insects clash by knocking their antennae together: the behaviour has been studied in ants, wasps and bees. Touching antennae does not always signal a beatdown: for example, honeybees rapidly touch antennae while exchanging food. But for letting others know who is boss, boxing is key.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a 2016 study, researchers used high-speed cameras to record four species of trap-jaw ants boxing with their antennae. The Florida native Odontomachus brunneus struck its opponent 41.5 times per second. The team described trap-jaw ants as \"the fastest boxers ever recorded\".\r\n",

However, modern research has shown that boxing matches are often started by females, who are not yet ready to mate and choose to fight off pushy suitors. Females only have brief windows of fertility, so males must be persistent.\r\n",

      "But it is kick-boxing where kangaroos really excel. With his opponent in a solid headlock, a dominant male can drive the message home â balancing on his tail and pummelling with his powerful legs, which are tipped with sharp claws.\r\n",

In his 2016 book Zebra Stripes, he describes how plains zebras deal with predators. Video footage has shown that the zebras kick lions in the chest, but there is no scientific record of these kicks being fatal.\r\n",

When you consider the ferocious jaws that might be snapping at their heels, it is little wonder that these animals can punt some serious punishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet these defensive moves are not intended to kill so much as repel. While a chance blow to a spine or jaw could prove deadly, the kicks are mostly a distraction to give the leggy prey animals a chance to run for safety.\r\n",

      "For truly lethal strikes, we need to look at predators â especially those with difficult diets.\r\n",

      "This same hunting style may also have been employed by some of the aptly-named terror birds: huge flightless birds that lived in prehistoric South America. Members of the Mesembriornis genus had very strong legs, according to analyses of recovered bone fragments. This has prompted scientists to suggest that the birds might have dished out bone-shattering kicks, as a way to access the nutritious bone marrow of their prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps we should all forget about floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee, and instead focus on punching like a shrimp and kicking like a bird.\n",
      "Build a web, catch a fly, wrap the fly in silk, then devour at leisure. This hunting strategy has proven so effective that orb-weaving spiders are one of the most successful groups of animals. They are found in almost every corner of the world and there are more than 3,000 species.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Making a web is a fairly sophisticated ploy. As well as multiple forms of silk and glue, the spider needs to perform a sequence of precise manoeuvres.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But why bother building your own web, when you can just invade somebody else's and devour the architect?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A clandestine group of spiders known as \"pirates\" have adopted this nefarious method of nabbing their prey. Their hunting strategies are among the most remarkable in the animal kingdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pirate spiders are members of the spider group that includes all the \"orb weavers\" â those that make the prototypical, circular webs we are all familiar with â but they do not make webs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, they have lost the ability. They can still produce silk, which they use to build egg sacs and wrap prey. But they are anatomically incapable of spinning a web. The number of silk \"spigots\" on their spinnerets is dramatically small compared to their relatives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instead, they invade the webs of other spiders, in a bid to lure and then kill the hapless architect. Gently, they pluck the strings of the web, enticing the host to approach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once the host spider has ventured close enough, the pirate makes its move.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, it encloses its duped prey within its two enormous front legs. These are fringed with massive spines, called \"macrosetae\", which they use to trap the host within a prison-like basket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, the final move: the pirate bites its prey and uses its fangs to inject a powerful venom that instantly immobilises it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a powerfully effective hunting technique.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It can be riveting to watch a pirate stealthily wandering while waving its long, first pair of legs to narrow in on the location of the other spider,\" says Mark Townley of the University of New Hampshire. \"Despite many hours spent feeding pirates for our studies on spinnerets, I never became jaded by the sight of them searching for and attacking prey. It was always a marvel to watch. They can wield that first pair of legs so delicately that I've seen them touch prey spiders so lightly without them reacting in any way, not seeming to even notice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we do not yet fully understand how the pirate's strategy works.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In particular, it is not clear why the pirate spiders pluck the strings of the host spider's web.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has long been assumed that the plucking mimics the vibrations caused by an ensnared insect. Hence the Latin name for pirate spiders: Mimetidae, or \"imitator\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, not all entomologists agree that this is what the pirate spiders are doing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The behaviour of resident spiders towards pirate spiders and their own prey is quite different, as are the vibrations in the web caused by these two sources,\" says Carl Kloock of California State University Bakersfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He has an alternative suggestion. \"It seems to me most likely that pirate spiders are mimicking the vibrations of web-invading spiders of the same species, and possibly spiders of different species,\" says Kloock. \"A spider on its web needs to defend its web â a valuable resource â from other spiders, who may try to take over the web to avoid the cost of building their own web, or simply try to steal prey from the web.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These encounters follow a pretty simple pattern, where the spiders signal at one another, then slowly approach each other, usually until the smaller spider gives up and flees the web.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think what the pirate spiders are doing is basically sending a deceptive signal representing themselves as small web invaders that refuse to flee, drawing the resident closer and closer until they are within attack range,\" Kloock adds.â â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then there is the matter of pirate spider venom, which has evolved to be extremely toxic towards other spiders, including members of their own species, but not towards other animals.\r\n",

      "\"Once another spider has been bitten it ceases to move, whereas fruit flies may struggle for several minutes,\" says Daniel Mott of Texas A&M International University. \"Their toxins appear to be very specific to other spiders.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why, and how, could such a strange hunting strategy evolve?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first problem is that the prey spiders are also predators, equipped with fangs and venom. This means they are more dangerous than, say, beetles or flies, and also less abundant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, pirate spiders are specialist predators. While they do sometimes feast on other prey, their main source of food is always spiders. By comparison, most orb-weaving spiders are generalist predators, eating whatever wanders into their web.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, pirates are not even capable of capturing other spiders without the web to stand on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the lab, if you put an orb weaver into a jar but don't allow it to spin a web, the pirate spider will not attack it,\" says Danilo Harms of the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It needs a web in order to capture another spider.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somehow, the ancestors of pirate spiders both lost the ability to weave their own webs, and became predators of other spiders to boot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Harms says the most plausible explanation is that it began with thievery. Pirate spiders' ancestors may have started invading the webs of other spiders, in order to steal the insects that the host had painstakingly trapped, poisoned and stored.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This filching behaviour has a colourful name: \"kleptoparasitism\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of the proto-pirates could have then taken this tactic to the next level, by preying on the host spiders themselves. Over time, they would then have become increasingly specialised for capturing other spiders: evolving unusually long front legs, sophisticated web-plucking behaviours, and spider-specific venom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This idea has been dubbed the \"kleptoparasitism-origin hypothesis\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whatever the reason for their quirky behaviour, pirate spiders are highly successful. Scientists have formally described more than 160 species, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We know a little bit about the biology of a tiny fraction of pirate spiders, but for most of the species we know literally nothing about their life history and behaviour,\" says Gustavo Hormiga of George Washington University. \"For example, virtually nothing is known about the biology of the beautifully bizarre South American tropical pirate spiders of the genus Gelanor.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this genus, the males' pedipalps â modified legs, which they use for inseminating females â are twice the length of the male's body. It may be that this allows them to inseminate females from a distance. \"In all other spiders, copulation requires that both partners are close to each other,\" says Hormiga. Mating at a distance would be a useful precaution, as pirate spiders are aggressive, possess potent venom, and are primed to prey on other arachnids, including their own kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they also have a gentler side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a study published in November 2016 in the journal Cladistics, Hormiga and his student Ligia Benavides described five new species. Their study also featured the first report of female pirate spiders caring for their young.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maternal care is relatively common in spiders. Some merely regurgitate prey for their young, while others go as far as allowing their spiderlings to feast upon their corpse. But maternal care had never been seen in the seemingly \"nasty\" pirate spiders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the field, we observed females of Mimetus, Anansi and Ero taking care of eggs and spiderlings. Pirates can be good mothers,\" says Benavides. \"In some instances, females had their eggs distributed evenly in a small web on the underside of a leaf. But if I moved a web or touched the spider, she would gather all the eggs or spiderlings quickly, create a ball with them, and carry them away in order to protect them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pirate spiders are clearly a tale unto themselves. However, their habit of imitating prey in order to devour another spider â an act known as \"aggressive mimicry\" â is not unique to them. It has evolved in arachnids independently at least twice before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a genus of jumping spiders known as Portia. These spiders also mimic prey, pluck the webs of unlucky host spiders, and devour them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like other jumping spiders, Portia spiders have enormous eyes and mostly rely on vision to seek out their prey. In contrast, pirates seem to rely more on their sense of touch. In the lab, covering their eyes with paint does little to hinder their attacks on other spiders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pirates and Portia spiders are fairly recent evolutionary developments. However, \"pelican spiders\" also feast on other arachnids â and they are so ancient, they pre-date the evolution of winged insects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pelican spiders owe their nickname to their phenomenally large jaws (technically \"chelicerae\") and elongated necks. Formally known as Archaeidae, they are also sometimes called \"assassin spiders\".\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With one chelicera they spear their prey. With the other, they inject the dangling, impaled spider with venom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pelican spiders have always preyed on other spiders â unlike the mimetids, which evolved from web-spinning spiders. They were first discovered from fossilised specimens in 1854, according to Harms, before living specimens were found in Madagascar in 1881.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So, if you are older than the radiation of insects, what could you eat? Potentially other spiders,\" says Harms. \"That's why they have such strange morphology.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Strange as it may seem, for some spiders feasting on the flesh of their spidery cousins is a great way to make a living.\r\n",

    "LDA is a complex algorithm which is generally perceived as hard to fine-tune and interpret. Indeed, getting relevant results with LDA requires a strong knowledge of how it works. In this lab we did not go into the technical details of how it works, but only explored on a high level how to use something like LDA for topic modelling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another thing is plural and singular forms. I would recommend lemmatizingâââor stemming if you cannot lemmatize but having stems in your topics is not easily understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing words with digits in them will also clean the words in your topics. Keeping years (2006, 1981) can be relevant if you believe they are meaningful in your topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering words that appear in at least 3 (or more) documents is a good way to remove rare words that will not be relevant in topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preparation\n",
    "Include bi- and tri-grams to grasp more relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another classic preparation step is to use only nouns and verbs using POS tagging (POS: Part-Of-Speech).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-tuning\n",
    "- Number of topics: try out several numbers of topics to understand which amount makes sense. You actually need to see the topics to know if your model makes sense or not. As for K-Means, LDA converges and the model makes sense at a mathematical level, but it does not mean it makes sense at a human level.\n",
    "- Cleaning your data: adding stop words that are too frequent in your topics and re-running your model is a common step. Keeping only nouns and verbs, removing templates from texts, testing different cleaning methods iteratively will improve your topics. Be prepared to spend some time here.\n",
    "- Alpha, Eta. We did not touch on the technical stuff in this lab. If implementing LDA using code, you can tweak alpha and eta to adjust your topics. Start with 'auto', and if the topics are not relevant, try other values. I recommend using low values of Alpha and Eta to have a small number of topics in each document and a small number of relevant words in each topic.\n",
    "- Increase the number of passes to have a better model. 3 or 4 is a good number, but you can go higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing results\n",
    "- Are your topics interpretable?\n",
    "- Are your topics unique? (two different topics have different words)\n",
    "- Are your topics exhaustive? (are all your documents well represented by these topics?)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model follows these 3 criteria, it looks like a good model :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main advantages of LDA\n",
    "### Itâs fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the %time command in Jupyter to verify it. The model is usually fast to run. Of course, it depends on your data. Several factors can slow down the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long documents\n",
    "- Large number of documents\n",
    "- Large vocabulary size (especially if you use n-grams with a large n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Itâs intuitive\n",
    "Modelling topics as weighted lists of words is a simple approximation yet a very intuitive approach if you need to interpret it. No embedding nor hidden dimensions, just bags of words with weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It can predict topics for new unseen documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model has run, it is ready to allocate topics to any document. Of course, if your training dataset is in English and you want to predict the topics of a Chinese document it wonât work. But if the new documents have the same structure and should have more or less the same topics, it will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main disadvantages of LDA\n",
    "### Lots of fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "If LDA is fast to run, it will give you some trouble to get good results with it. Thatâs why knowing in advance how to fine-tune it will really help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It needs human interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics are found by a machine. A human needs to label them in order to present the results to non-experts people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You cannot influence topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that some of your documents talk about a topic you know, and not finding it in the topics found by LDA will definitely be frustrating. And thereâs no way to say to the model that some words should belong together. You have to sit and wait for the LDA to give you what you want."
